    "In this notebook we will consider a situation in which a model that we constructed is no longer working as we intended. In particular, we will look at the XGBoost sentiment analysis model that we constructed earlier. In this case, however, we have some new data that our model doesn't seem to perform very well on. As a result, we will re-train our model and update an existing endpoint so that it uses our new model.\n",

Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `# TODO: ...` comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

       "'Save the $8.97 you\\'ll spend at Walmart to buy this DVD and go see the real film by Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />I\\'m a filmmaker, and being an avid fan of H.G. Wells, I had to buy this hoping to sit down and watch three hours of good entertainment. Instead, it took four days to finish watching this because I couldn\\'t stand watching more than 10 minutes at a time. It\\'s horrible.<br /><br />There are reports that Timothy Hines had a $20 Million budget for this production. Where the heck did it go? Did he use most of it to buy a new house? Finance his retirement? Or what? Let me start with what is actually good about this film. It does stay true to the book AND there are a few good performances in it. I can respect the actors who obviously tried to make this a good film. But good performances were quickly overshadowed by horrible... and I do mean horrible special effects. Any freshman film school student could have done a much better job with the CGI. To me, most of it looked like \"stop action\" card board cutouts that were used rather than sophisticated CGI software that a $20 Million project should be using.<br /><br />There\\'s no excuse for the amateur post production that was applied to this film. My own partner and I sat down and recreated our version of the Ferry scene using software that cost less than $1500.00 and within a day had five minutes of scene that looked better and more realistic than what Hines created. I\\'ve seen films with budgets of less than $2 Million look better. Much better.<br /><br />In my opinion the special effects used in the original King Kong were more sophisticated and better than Hines\\' special effects in this film. IN fact, I have a much better appreciation for Attack of the Killer Tomatoes because of this film. There\\'s no excuse with today\\'s technology for a film to look like a 50\\'s B-Movie unless that was the intention, which shouldn\\'t have been with this particular project.<br /><br />A problem I had with the DVD transfer was that the film is jerky, another demonstration of amateur film-making.<br /><br />Overall, I have to say that I produced a $45,000 project in 2003 that have better cinematography and special effects than this film.<br /><br />I strongly encourage anyone who appreciates good film-making or who is a fan of WOTW to leave this film on the shelf and watch Attack of the 50 Foot Woman instead. It would be easier on the eyes.'"

That is, we don't necessarily need to use our model's results immediately and instead we can peform inference on a large number of samples.

In part, this is because it is meant to be a little bit closer to the type of problem you may face in a real world scenario. Of course, this problem is a very easy one with a prescribed solution, but there are many other interesting questions that we did not consider here and that you may wish to consider yourself.\n",

    "The default notebook instance on SageMaker doesn't have a lot of excess disk space available. As you continue to complete and execute notebooks you will eventually fill up this disk space, leading to errors which can be difficult to diagnose. Once you are completely finished using a notebook it is a good idea to remove the files that you created along the way. Of course, you can do this from the terminal or from the notebook hub if you would like. The cell below contains some commands to clean up the created files from within the notebook."
